0,It's missing something?
1,Great movie and great tribute to Stan Lee at the end
2,"A bit long (great cast, but less action than other Marvel movies)."
3,This movie is awesome!  
4,I loved Avengers: Endgame! The film is so good. The cast is amazing! The soundtrack is great. The end of the movie is great. The plot is great. Avengers: Endgame is the movie event of the decade.
5,Best movie ever!!!!!!
6,Really good-- Full of action and many twists and turns-- Must see in a theater:)
7,"the movie was amazing... however, the theatre was lacking. the screen had a hole in it which messed with the overall viewing experience. and the theatre popcorn and drink prices are ridiculous."
8,"Why was it so long? No-One would have known the Comics, from yesterday-years....🤔🧐🤔🧐🤔💯💯💯🕺🏽"
9,"Every person that saw this movie was tricked into believing that what they saw was good. Disney put out a movie that was 3 hours and 5minutes with 2 hours of footage that was already seen or unrelavant. It was anticlimactic and overall boring. You watch scenes from the first avengers and infinity war just to arrive at an “epic battle” that would ruin the actual marvel timeline and movie to come. They had a poor excuse for a time travel theory so that they could make this terrible movie. Waste of TIME and money. Glad they made a movie to please the comic book fans, rather than just taking my money."
