Staircase
A child is running up a staircase with N steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up to the stairs. You need to return number of possible ways W.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer N (No. of steps) 
Output Format :
Line 1 : Integer W i.e. Number of possible ways
Constraint :
(1 <= N <= 30)
Sample Input 1:
4
Sample Output :
7
def countWays(n) : 
    res = [0] * (n + 1) 
    res[0] = 1
    res[1] = 1
    res[2] = 2
      
    for i in range(3, n + 1) : 
        res[i] = res[i - 1] + res[i - 2] + res[i - 3] 
      
    return res[n] 
  
n=int(input())
print(countWays(n))
